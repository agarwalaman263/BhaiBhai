# STATIC CODE ANALYZER WEB SERVICE

The static-code-analyser-webservice is a gating service (used for java projects), which is used to check if a 
project passes the thresholds for different kinds of code analysis, which can be set by the user.

The code analyser comprises of 6 different types of tools, which are-

Simian Tool, for duplication in code- https://www.harukizaemon.com/simian/   

Jacoco, for code coverage- https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/

Visual code grepper, for security vulnerablities- https://github.com/nccgroup/VCG, For installation - http://zerosxones.blogspot.com/2017/05/static-code-analysis-visual-code-grepper_17.html 

PMD, for static warnings-https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/

Cyvis, for cyclometric complexity- http://cyvis.sourceforge.net/download.html

These tools are being used behind the stage to check if the project complies with the needs of the user
or not, and as a result we get a go (if the code passes through all the 6 tool's thresholds) or a
no go (if the tool fails to do so).

The project, so far, runs on the localhost. Hence, you can give any of the projects that are present
on the localhost (the path to the project, along with the project name, are the inputs taken by
the tool), and all the tools work together to give the results, in different forms. 
The tools and the types of output are as follows-

PMD- a .xml file is generated
Cyvis- creates a .txt file
Simian tool- gives the output on the console itself, as 0 (if no issues) or 1 (if there are duplicates).
VisualCodeGrepper – creates a .txt file.
Jacoco – creates a .csv file
Junit test time compilation – gives the output on the console (time taken to run unit tests).

 
We extract the data from the files/results that are generated by the tools, and parse them to produce
useful data, which is in turn used to generate an output, which can be checked against the thresholds
that are set by the user themselves. hence, a go or a no-go result is generated.

Thresholds set :

1. CyclomaticComplexity - 3
2. Code Coverage - 80
3. UnitTestTime - 20
4. SecurityVulnerabilities - 0
5. StaticWarnings - 0
6. Duplicates - 0   

API Documentation : 

We used a swagger to figure out RESTFull endpoints i,e GET,POST and other requests.The link for the swagger is given below
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/

For the same API document swagger to work on your machine, you need to dump run the batch file and then use the link with your localhost(with port number).

AutoBuildTest.bat :

This batch file will run all the maven commands along with simian(for duplicates) and jacoco(for code coverage).Then,it runs the spring-boot application.
